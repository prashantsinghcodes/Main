Types of linked lists :

1. Singly ll
2. doubly ll
3. circular ll
4. circular doubly ll

1. Singly ll :
    operations :
    -> create node with data and next
    -> create linkedlist with head
    -> insertAtHead(int d)
    -> insertAtTail(int d)
    -> insertAtPosition(int position, int d)
    -> print() or traverse singly linkedlist
    -> deleteAtPosition(int position)
2. Doubly ll :
    operations :
    -> create node with prev, data and next
    -> create DoublyLinkedList with head
    -> insertAtHead(int d)
    -> insertAtTail(int d)
    -> insertAtPosition(int position, int d)
    -> getLength() of the Doubly LL
    -> print() or traverse the doubly linkedlist
    -> deleteAtPosition(int position)
