Types of linked lists :

1. Singly ll
2. doubly ll
3. circular ll
4. circular doubly ll

1. Singly ll :
    operations :
    -> create node with data and next
    -> create linkedlist with head
    -> insertAtHead(int d)
    -> insertAtTail(int d)
    -> insertAtPosition(int position, int d)
    -> print() or traverse singly linkedlist
    -> deleteAtPosition(int position)
2. Doubly ll :
    operations :
    -> create node with prev, data and next
    -> create DoublyLinkedList with head
    -> insertAtHead(int d)
    -> insertAtTail(int d)
    -> insertAtPosition(int position, int d)
    -> getLength() of the Doubly LL
    -> print() or traverse the doubly linkedlist
    -> deleteAtPosition(int position)
3. Circular Linked List :
    opertaions :
     -> create circular linked list with tail pointing to any node(first in this case)
        and last node pointing to first node
     -> insertNode(int element, int value) - insert a node with value after element
     -> traversal
     -> deleteNode(int value) - search value and delete the node
